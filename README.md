# CSS Inserter
 Inserts user-defined css snippets into the selected text.
 This is a fork of [Style Text](https://github.com/juanjoarranz/style-text-obsidian-plugin).

 CSS Inserter allows you to create as many CSS snippets as you wish and apply them to the text that's currently selected.

 The main difference between this and [Style Text](https://github.com/juanjoarranz/style-text-obsidian-plugin) is that you can specify the html tag, the class, and the style for each CSS snippet.

 See [Style Text's README](https://github.com/juanjoarranz/style-text-obsidian-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#obsidian-style-text) for instructions.
